# Draw-a-graph
first input the view-screen of the graph and than input any function you want plotted.

use xgraph if you want to plot an f(x) function, if you want to plot an f(y) function use ygraph.

The ygraph is hard to read because it is a simple eddited version of the xgraph and not all names have been changed.
